## 📖 Process & Reflection
1. **Exploration** – Researched Bootstrap 5 examples and components.
2. **Component Remixing** – Selected and adapted components (navbar, hero, cards, forms, footer).
3. **Page Design** – Created three main pages (Home, About, Contact) plus a Thank You page.
4. **Styling** – Added a custom CSS file for hover effects, typography, and footer adjustments.
5. **Responsiveness** – Ensured layouts work on mobile, tablet, and desktop using Bootstrap’s grid system.
6. **Deployment** – Pushed code to GitHub and hosted the site using GitHub Pages.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Making the footer stick at the bottom on short pages.
- Ensuring the layout remained consistent across breakpoints.

**Solutions:**
- Used Flexbox (`display: flex; flex-direction: column; min-height: 100vh;`) to fix footer issue.
- Applied Bootstrap’s grid (`row`, `col-md-4`) and utility classes (`p-3`, `my-5`) for spacing.

**Time Taken:** 30 mins
